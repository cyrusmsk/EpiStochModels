Getting started with EpiStochModels
================================================
EpistochModels can be installed from source (if you clone our `Github repository <https://github.com/fccoelho/EpiStochModels>`_).

But first you must have a **D** compiler installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl https://dlang.org/install.sh | bash -s

Then you can build and install the Python package. 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install

We will publish the package on PyPI soon so that you will be able to simply pip install it.
